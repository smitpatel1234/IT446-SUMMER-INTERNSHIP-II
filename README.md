## Conclusion 🎓  
Over six weeks, the project evolved from a basic Django setup into a scalable, optimized copy trading system featuring:  
- API delay optimized to under 1 second with Redis and Pub/Sub ⚡  
- Core Master and Client modules for trading operations 🏗️  
- Real-time order monitoring with SmartAPI 👁️  
- Multi-client concurrency handling 🧵  
- Redis caching and concurrency optimizations 💾  
- react.js frontend integration 🖥️  
- Docker containerization and AWS hosting research ☁️🐳  

This internship greatly enhanced my skills in backend optimization, real-time systems development, and deployment.
